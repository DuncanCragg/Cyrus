        "On the right, you see two views of what are called 'items' in Cyrus."
        "The middle panel has the raw Cyrus 'code', and the right panel has the resulting 'render'."
        "Type 'World!' after 'Hello' in the middle panel. Then hit 'Update' below it."
        "The far panel should update accordingly. Hit refresh if it doesn't for some reason."
