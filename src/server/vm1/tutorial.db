        "In Cyrus, you only type what you care about for what you're trying to achieve; you don't write code just for the computer's benefit, to tell it how to do things it really should already know!"
        "Things like saving, loading, notifying updates, re-calculating dependencies, constructing and reacting to user interfaces, integration between distributed components, etc."
        "On the right, you see two views of what are called 'objects' in Cyrus. The middle panel has the raw Cyrus 'code', and the right panel has the resulting 'render'. Currently they look the same."

        "The numbers '1 1 0' are the red, green and blue values of the light. You may know that red + green makes yellow. Try other numbers between zero and one for the three colour elements."
