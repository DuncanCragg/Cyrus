NetMash is an Object Network implementation in Java.

It includes an Android app with 3D and some code to adapt to Minecraft and the Raspberry Pi.

It's experimental at the moment so you probably shouldn't be reading this, you should be reading the code or something. Or contacting me.

Vision: NetMash will empower you to easily build, mash up, animate and program your own corner of an open, global, online, shared world (including 3D virtual and augmented reality). A world that is all linked up, just like the Web. You will be able to create objects within the live online world, then animate them on the spot with simple rules.  NetMash is an open Java server and Android app. And Minecraft Mod, obviously. And Raspberry Pi I/O driver.
