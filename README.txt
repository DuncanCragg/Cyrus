NetMash is Apps Without Boundaries!

See http://netmash.net for an Android quick-start:

Run the emulator with Google maps at API 7, then:

$ make            -- allows you to edit the JSON, then installs the app and runs the server

$ make runtests   -- just JSON tests at the moment
$ make runall     -- run up two vms and run some examples
