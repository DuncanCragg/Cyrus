NetMash is the Cyrus language implementation in Java, part of the Object Network:

It includes an Android app with 3D and some code to adapt to Minecraft and the Raspberry Pi.

It's experimental at the moment so you probably shouldn't be reading this, you should be reading the code or something. Or contacting me.
