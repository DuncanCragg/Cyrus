NetMash

See http://netmash.net - it's experimental at the moment so you probably shouldn't be
reading this, you should be reading the code or something. Or contacting me.

Run the emulator with Google maps at API 10-16, then:

$ make mesh       -- installs the app for local, no server
$ make            -- installs the app and runs the server
