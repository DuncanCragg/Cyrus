Cyrus

See http://the-cyrus.net - it's experimental at the moment so you probably shouldn't be
reading this, you should be reading the code or something. Or contacting me.

Browser:

$ make runode   -- needed first: runs up a little Node server for some statics
$ make examples -- some examples
$ make tutorial -- interactive online tutorial (coming soon)
$ make cars     -- querying a database of driving licences

Android:

.. run the emulator with Google maps at API 10-16, then:

$ make emu -- build for the emulator
$ make lan -- build for plugged-in device
$ make cap -- land subsidies with maps

Tests:

$ make tests -- JSON, UID and Cyrus Language tests
$ make cyrus -- just the Cyrus Language tests
$ make uid   -- generate some UIDs
