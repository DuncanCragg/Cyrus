NetMash is..

 - a JSON or mobile-related data browser (and server)

 - that empowers the user to create, mash and animate their own stuff and apps

 - programmed in declarative JSON and JSON animation rules (in client and on server)

 - that fixes many of the problems of HTML/JS/CSS browsers

    - talking in semantic terms, not just presentational
       - mobile stuff like identity, contacts, events, media, news, etc

    - two-way and dynamic data
       - auto-syncing, sending, saving, downloading, refreshing, etc

    - allowing much closer access to native functionality
       - including offline and better cacheing

    - one language, Media/Content Type (One-T) for data, animation, layout and styling

 - but keeps the mashability and cacheability of the Web

    - there are no application boundaries, API boundaries, silos, walled gardens, identity boundaries


the Web was for the PC age; the Object Net (and NetMash) is for the mobile age
