-----

Functionality

 - is:cube object generates that mesh
 - first animation rule
 - cube on server viewed by two clients, updating on edit or animation
 - two cubes on a floor container

Fixes

 - projection not re-setting properly on landscape
 - lighting all wrong: model, camera, lightpos needs sorting
 - no texture on Nexus
 - rebinding the texture when it comes in
 - all those efficiency improvements noted in the code
 - fix 100% and heap churn (only in emu?) when no connection to server

Fjord

 - two-phase: do all LHS, accumulate $s, RHS
 - contentAll everywhere
 - %more like jumping lists
 - "<#>payment": { .. }

 - Android radio efficiency http://developer.android.com/training/efficient-downloads/efficient-network-access.html

HTTP
 - still two network conns on main thread: at start and images
 - 201 Created may be missed
 - 403 if not observing
 - poll while waiting - max-age
 - need to hang POST responses so not POST requests; should be 204
    - actually this is long-polling GET for C-N=object URL not cache

Stuff 

 - hello world stdio interface object - user object on command line

FuncObs 

 - make etag increment atomic with state change - put all in '%'s?
 - allow relative links
 - option to bail via exception if observed object not there

Overall

 - tighten up thread syncing
 - HTTP.java longPollerPool concurrentmod.txt

Types

 - queryable not searchable
 - always roundtrip extra tags in queryable
 - preview (?) not summary?
