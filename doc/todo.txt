To Do
-----

 * fix 100% and heap churn when no connection to server
 * add navigation: first left/right, then movement


Fjord

 - two-phase: do all LHS, accumulate $s, RHS
 - contentAll everywhere
 - %more like jumping lists
 - "<#>payment": { .. }
 - "<a|b>": ..

Android

 - Android radio efficiency http://developer.android.com/training/efficient-downloads/efficient-network-access.html

HTTP
 - still two network conns on main thread: at start and images
 - 201 Created may be missed
 - 403 if not observing
 - poll while waiting - max-age
 - need to hang POST responses so not POST requests; should be 204
    - actually this is long-polling GET for C-N=object URL not cache

Stuff 

 - hello world stdio interface object - user object on command line

FuncObs 

 - make etag increment atomic with state change - put all in '%'s?
 - allow relative links
 - option to bail via exception if observed object not there

Overall

 - tighten up thread syncing
 - HTTP.java longPollerPool concurrentmod.txt

Types

 - queryable not searchable
 - always roundtrip extra tags in queryable
 - preview (?) not summary?
