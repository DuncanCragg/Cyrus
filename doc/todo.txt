To Do
-----

Functionality

 - chat, "saying": ".."
 - avatar POSTs rotations
 - is:cube object generates that mesh
    - or create sphere mesh and sphere object - blender or unity?
 - split-screen and/or easy-flip
 - teleport coords on back button (save coords in history, thus also scroll state)
 - walking law to smooth/animate movement if is: avatar

Animations to enable

 - turn on lights when someone comes in (need per-obj lighting)
 - mars rover - can assume matrix/vector maths!
 - cube that stays cubic when rescaled
 - introduce time into Fjord, rotate slowly
 - react to touch (need touch, then)

Speed, Bugfixes, Robustness, Clean formats

 - put limit on render recursion depth and detect already-rendered-at-xyz
 - projection not re-setting properly on landscape
 - lighting all wrong: model, camera, lightpos needs sorting
 - rebinding the texture when it comes in (and 256x256 don't forget)
 - all those efficiency improvements noted in the code
 - think about multiple POSTs of user
 - remove mesh and gui nesting
 - fix 100% and heap churn (only in emu?) when no connection to server

Fjord

 - two-phase: do all LHS, accumulate $s, RHS
 - contentAll everywhere
 - %more like jumping lists
 - "<#>payment": { .. }
 - "<a|b>": ..
 - fail-to-match rewrites (e.g. turn light off if no visitors)

Android

 - Android radio efficiency http://developer.android.com/training/efficient-downloads/efficient-network-access.html

HTTP
 - match to uid not URL - e.g when fetch 192.168.. and C-L set to 10.0.2.2
 - still two network conns on main thread: at start and images
 - 201 Created may be missed
 - 403 if not observing
 - poll while waiting - max-age
 - need to hang POST responses so not POST requests; should be 204
    - actually this is long-polling GET for C-N=object URL not cache

Stuff 

 - hello world stdio interface object - user object on command line

FuncObs 

 - make etag increment atomic with state change - put all in '%'s?
 - allow relative links
 - option to bail via exception if observed object not there

Overall

 - tighten up thread syncing
 - HTTP.java longPollerPool concurrentmod.txt

Types

 - queryable not searchable
 - always roundtrip extra tags in queryable
 - preview (?) not summary?
