To Do
-----

Speed, Bugfixes, Robustness, Clean formats

 - client and server cycling and long/short poll
 - too chatty on the wire
 - no logging except from-to net transfers
 - think about multiple POSTs of user
 - fix 100% and heap churn (only in emu?) when no connection to server
 - ?? GC_CONCURRENT freed 513K, 12% free 8020K/9031K, paused 1ms+2ms, total 21ms
GL
 - efficiency in Render as in comments
 - rebinding the texture when it comes in (and 256x256 don't forget)
 - put limit on render recursion depth and detect already-rendered-at-xyz
 - lighting all wrong: model, camera, lightpos needs sorting
 - projection not re-setting properly on landscape
 - remove mesh and gui nesting
 - floor textures didn't come out

Object/Net/Mash views

 - fix view/edit not to use nested views: HTML?
    - render rules specially as recognised type
    - render JSON as recognised ObNet type: %rules, %more, is, etc known
    - constraints of JSON needn't be at all visible in gui
    - smooth over ugliness: %, "", etc
 - split-screen and/or easy-flip: Object, Object Net, Object Mash
    - this has to be really easy and nice to use
    - it's an IDE like Victor .. lighttable
    - visual instantiation of rules - step through, see each rule firing and rewriting
    - an IDE that extends beyond the team into the world..
 - expand sub-linked objects, so easy to build link-jumping rule
 - touch 3D object brings up menu with go to Object/Net/Mash views options

Object Mash

 - split when-then and functions
 - render when and then in different colours
 - strings in rules are all language, so single-tick quotes for literals
 - not "list(a,b)" but [a,b]; [ +, a, b ] not "sum(a,b)", etc
 - prod->multiply or *(),+() or x+y x*y
 - JSON reduction trees - iteration not recursion
 - * anything, # nothing
 - %rules, etc as reserved words
 - is touch event a form linking to user? as you move, it updates?
 - attaching accelerometer value to an object: %alerted, then watch user
 - two-phase: do all LHS, accumulate $s, RHS, edits
 - contentAll everywhere
 - %more like jumping lists
 - "<#>payment": { .. }
 - "<a|b>": ..
 - fail-to-match rewrites (e.g. turn light off if no visitors)

Examples dotted around on arrival

 - is:cube object generates that mesh
 - is:sphere object and mesh - Blender


Functionality

 - chat, "saying": ".."
 - avatar POSTs rotations
 - teleport coords on back button (save coords in history, thus also scroll state)
 - walking law to smooth/animate movement if is: avatar
 - physics; collision; touch; time

Android

HTTP
 - match to uid not URL - e.g when fetch 192.168.. and C-L set to 10.0.2.2
 - still two network conns on main thread: at start and images
 - 201 Created may be missed
 - 403 if not observing
 - poll while waiting - max-age
 - need to hang POST responses so not POST requests; should be 204
    - actually this is long-polling GET for C-N=object URL not cache

Stuff 

 - hello world stdio interface object - user object on command line

FuncObs 

 - make etag increment atomic with state change - put all in '%'s?
 - allow relative links
 - option to bail via exception if observed object not there

Overall

 - tighten up thread syncing
 - HTTP.java longPollerPool concurrentmod.txt

Types

 - queryable not searchable
 - always roundtrip extra tags in queryable
 - preview (?) not summary?
