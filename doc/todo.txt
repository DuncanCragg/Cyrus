------------------------
 + holding link to a place/region, touch place, work out displacement from sub-region hit
    + Cyrus rule on target region detects user state and adds adjacent region with displacement off that coords
    + use 'within .. of' - rename to avoid clash with within: - divide floor into nine boxes, test within and place at that side/corner
    + if user present (same within as this target)
------------------------
 + { is: user holding: .. touching: { item: .. position: .. within: { item: .. position: .. } } }
 + target adds link to object at coord:
   (a) place - point touched
   (b) object - point touched (relative to object coords)
   (c) voxel - within notified with voxel coords and voxel-relative touched coords
   (d) linked/shared object - within notified with object coords and object-rel touched coords
   (e) linked place - notify current place within to remove, etc
 + within if a shared link: if no within or within not here
    + notify within not shared object
------------------------
------------------------
In-World (non-edit) Link management
 - show link holding as texture for icon
 - object edit to see links - "everything has a link"
 + grab a viewed object/region's link, or any object/region's link
 - grab rules/materials links off an object/region
 - grab links from remote site lists
 + first cut: last link grabbed=holding
 - into link chooser, organised by type for context, sorted by recent, select->holding
 - choice of material blocks to hold/place along bottom, variant of generic link chooser
 + request add/rem link at location relative to object/region
 - request add/rem links for rules and materials on any object/region: add to list at N, remove Nth in list
 - request add/rem links in global rules
 - operations: grab/add/rem/cut
 + local or remote user, Java animates user and notifies target or its within
 + minecraft: left on block=hitting xyz; left on entity=hitting URL; right on block=placing xyz; right on entity=touching URL
 + add: Cyrus sees I'm holding this link, interacting with this target
    - coords touched on an object: object has to work out what displacement to add, or to pass to its within
    + if beyond current region, touch white grid
    - posn implied by touching a neighbour if voxels
    - ultimately ability to add a block of type defined somewhere else - may need to clone with its links
 + rem: hitting by touch with holding nothing or a tool: link and position on 'within' object/region
    + send user hit action to linker of object/region - the within of the user
 - { is: user holding: <link to object/region>, touching: { on: <target link> coords: 7 within: <holder of> position: <coords in holder> } }
 - { is: user holding: <link to ruleset/texture/shader/sound> (un-)animating/texturing/shading/sounding:  }
 - type of ruleset/shader by is:
 - type of texture/sound by extension (ug - and ug everywhere), or fetch/inspect, or came from there, or explicit GUI choice
 + separate { sub-objects: .. places: .. users: .. } (cubes:, entities:, structures: in MC)
    + placing object -> sub-objects: .. joining region -> places: .. presence track -> users:
 + Java finds nearest place - User automatically set 'within' nearest enclosing region (can only be within: places: objects)
 + Cyrus presence tracker: effectively user requests by within to add/rem link to it in users: of target region at current position
 + Cyrus rule: user then requests to add/rem other links; OK if present, calculate displacement
 - request to set global rules on a site object/region

World Basics
 - blue sky; ambient light; day/night - region object: { night/day }
 - blank white grid is your region, can add stuff or link blocks in-world
 - { is: voxels  chunks: uid-y uid-z } using existing cubes; same one linked?
 - physics pulling you down; collision with blocks; vertical movement of avatar
 - copy minecraft navigation controls; velocity and look up/down and both together (touch on release if in that quadrant and not moved)
------------------------
In-World Editing
 - remove all current in-3D edit crap
 - edit forces correct syntax and has undo
 - on tablet, split edit/view
 - edit params and properties of objects, edit animation rules
------------------------
More stuff:
 # mystery adding users bug - rotation?
 # loss of list structure when round-tripped to web (e.g. MC tutorial, Rob's place)
 - make sure MC-like Web page functions work still - global rules, tutorial, editing
 # bug: presence detector picks up form submissions and swipes (fix blue bot)
 # bug: avatar still visible
 # fix: compress cyrus.db
 # fix: doc/local/contentList.txt search for potential single-element lists
 # fix: doc/local/contentAPIeval.txt evaluate() or evaluatable()? see trace
 # fix: lighting: boxes not lit well by blue bot, etc
 - ---
 - later generate room; editable
 - add world edit stuff later, by Cyrus rules probably
 - textures 1=all, 2=top/bottom+sides 3=top, bottom, sides, 4=top, bottom, opposite sides
------------------------
 + OM tests: { is: !place } should fail due to not matching { .. } Alerted:holding:is returns null, matches !place ? test with uid-not-here
 + transient Alerted no good - even if it did allow you to see through a link in it - cos link may need cacheing
 + what if a /rule/ isn't cached and you get an Alerted? it'll be missed, presumably
 + prevent access to Alerted fields - @Alerted:<path>
 + do presence detect in Cyrus as part of fixing user Alerted when placing
