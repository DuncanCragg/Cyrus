HTTP
 - 201 Created may be missed
 - 403 if not observing
 - poll while waiting - max-age
 - need to hang POST responses so not POST requests; should be 204
    - actually this is long-polling GET for C-N=object URL not cache

Stuff 

 - hello world stdio interface object - user object on command line

FuncObs 

 - make etag increment atomic with state change - put all in '%'s?
 - allow relative links
 - option to bail via exception if observed object not there

Overall

 - tighten up thread syncing
