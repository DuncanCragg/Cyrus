------------------------
Fix stuff:
 - avatar still visible
------------------------
Add stuff:
 - { is: voxels  chunks: uid-y uid-z } using existing cubes
 - textures 1=all, 2=top/bottom+sides 3=top, bottom, sides, 4=top,bottom, opposite sides
 - copy minecraft navigation controls
 - touch to place, hold to remove - add world edit stuff later, by Cyrus rules probably
 - choice of blocks to place along bottom
 - multitouch to interact
 - and edit by toggling edit button and touching target
 - edit forces correct syntax and has undo
 - on tablet, split edit/view
 - physics pulling you down; collision with blocks
 - user object: { position, hitting, placing, multitouch interacting }
 - region object: { night/day }
 - global mods with checkboxes as in MC
 - link chooser for region linking and rule/mod linking
------------------------
Expand to demoable state: see plan
------------------------
Other stuff:
 - doc/local/contentList.txt search for potential single-element lists
 - doc/local/contentAPIeval.txt evaluate() or evaluatable()? see trace
 - later generate room; editable
 - compress cyrus.db
 - boxes not lit well by blue box, etc
