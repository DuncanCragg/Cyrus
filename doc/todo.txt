To Do
-----

 - HTTP - 403 if not observing
 - HTTP - poll while waiting - max-age
 - HTTP - need to hang POST responses so not POST requests; should be 204
        - actually this is long-polling GET for C-N=object URL not cache

 - Logic - hello world stdio interface object - user object on command line

 - FuncObs - make etag increment atomic with state change - put all in '%'s?
 - FuncObs - allow relative links
 - FuncObs - option to bail via exception if observed object not there

 - Overall - tighten up thread syncing
