 - render sub-item link to other region if visible
    - pull in structures and slice if they overrun

 - in another's region, need a structure to override your hacking (like they do currently)
    - so region sends scanning-for-blocks to their region/place/ex-world
    - scanning-for-blocks always fitted to nearest cube(s)
    - or - they make structure or cube in your region, triggers making counter-cube, which does wiping back /and/ slicing


Bits

 - oops, scanning=structure but does getSubItemsAround: sub-items of entities; it's more like a little region, with sub-items
 - coal 173, etc new blocks
 - make sure minecraft and minecraft_server done together
 - rule to save world-view without pigs/cows mod
 - player speed for zombie rule, and fix for non-one zombie cases (0, 2+); not speed: => #
 - player position, target-position, holding, spawn-position, alive, hitting, placing, touching (doc/local/player-properties.db)
 - spawn position? saved in client? getBedLocation or what?
 - placing clashes
 - use bin not lib?
 - evaluate() or evaluatable()? see trace doc/local/contentAPIeval.txt
 - no x/z speed sent over wire?
 - players:0 may be empty so add more checks
 - clashing cyrus.db and cyrusconfig.db/port
 - holding doesn't always update until used
