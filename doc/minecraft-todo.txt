Minecraft+NetMash+Cyrus demo

 - it's Minecraft+NetMash code, implementing Cyrus
 - showing language and types in browser
 - show off the language mainly - map-reduce type stuff
 - pure functional -vs- OO, state -vs- process/fn, monads, state-state, DSLs, rules, Clojure identity, Datomic, state vs events and FP, FRP, Rx

 * better way to place structures - wooden tools to point - copy/paste
    - has most of the interesting things in it
    - scan area into structure, clone structure with new position, change materials

 - debug pig example
 - names of blocks matching gui names
 - patterns of block types in structures
 - how to build a house programmatically
 - write up all the Minecraft types - structures and behaviours

 - fix annoying browser refresh when editing or looking
 - fix maximisation loss when updated
 - make fix-max a separate thing or highlight somehow

 - slice if they overrun
 - in another's region, need a structure to override your hacking (like they do currently)
    - so region sends scanning-for-blocks to their region/place/ex-world
    - scanning-for-blocks always fitted to nearest cube(s)
    - or - they make structure or cube in your region, triggers making counter-cube, which does wiping back /and/ slicing

Bits

 - Cyrus makefile make install can curl MCP into subdir then grab minecraft_server jar, decompile, add links, apply patch
 - what if patch changed or need a new link?

 - handling regions coming up and going down
 - oops, scanning=structure but does getEntitiesAround: sub-items of entities; it's more like a little region, with sub-items
 - coal 173, etc new blocks
 - make sure minecraft and minecraft_server done together
 - rule to save world-view without pigs/cows mod
 - player speed for zombie rule, and fix for non-one zombie cases (0, 2+); not speed: => #
 - player position, target-position, holding, spawn-position, alive, hitting, placing, touching (doc/local/player-properties.db)
 - spawn position? saved in client? getBedLocation or what?
 - 'placing' clashes
 - use bin not lib?
 - no x/z speed sent over wire?
 - players:0 may be empty so add more checks
 - clashing cyrus.db and cyrusconfig.db/port
 - holding doesn't always update until used
